# I don’t know how to translate my ideas into code

Getting out of tutorial hell is hella hard, because following someone else is comfortable and easy. However, you don’t learn how to code by mindlessly typing along. And even if you think deeply about how the code works, when the time comes for you to implement it on your own, you’re stuck.

That’s why I have decided to dedicate *~~more time~~* the majority of time to solving problems and building my own projects.

My primary resource for diving deeper into learning OOP is CodeGym’s Java Quests. They have more than 1k challenging tasks and mini-projects to complete.

P.S. Progress not perfection.

*Completing the entire course will give you 500-1000 hours of programming experience. This is the minimum you need to establish your ability to "think like a programmer"*
