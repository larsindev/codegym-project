# I don’t know how to translate my ideas into code

Getting out of tutorial hell is hella hard, because following someone else is comfortable and easy. However, you don’t learn how to code by mindlessly typing along. And even if you think deeply about how the code works, when the time comes for you to implement it on your own, you’re stuck.

That’s why I have decided to dedicate more time to solving problems and building projects on my own.

My primary resource for diving deeper into learning OOP will be CodeGym’s Java Quests. They have more than 1k challanging tasks and mini-projects to complete.

P.S. Progress not perfection.
